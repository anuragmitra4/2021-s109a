    "**1.2** Create a subset of the `covid_raw` data frame that only contains the measures for 5 dates: June 27 and July 4, 11, 18 and 25.  Do the same for the `vaccines_raw`.  Call these subsets `covid` and `vaccines`, respectively, and print out their dimensions (aka, shapes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.3** Determine and print the number of counties that are measured for each time period in `covid` and `vaccines` (do not print out the list of counties, just the number/count).  Comment on what this implies for presence of missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.4** Process both `covid` and `vaccines` so that each county is represented by a single row in each data frame (rather than having 5 separate rows for each county: 1 for each time period in part 1.2).  Call these new generate Pandas data frames `covid_by_county` and `vaccines_by_county` separately.  Print out the dimensions of each resulting data frame, and view the header of `covid_by_county`.  Note: you should use informative names for the columns in the resulting data frames: for example, `cases_w30` for the cumulative number of cases on July 25 (it's the 30th week of the calendar year).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: Splitting based on dates and then using `pd.DataFrame.merge` (source)[https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html] could be helpful for this task using the `fips` code as the keys to join on (you should drop any counties that are not measured in all time periods...the default argument for `how` in `pd.DataFrame.merge` will behave this way).\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.5** Merge the 4 data fames (`covid_by_county`, `vaccines_by_county`, `masks`, and `demo`) based on `fips` and save the result as `covid_merged` (you should drop any counties that are not measured in all 4 data frames).  Determine and report how many counties were dropped from `demo` in this process, and view the header of `covid_merged`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.6** Use `covid_merged` to calculate the novel case rate (per 1000 residents) for each of the weeks for all of the counties, and save these as 4 new well-named variables in `covid_merged`.  For example, `rate_w30` can mathematically be represented as `1000*(cases_30-cases_29)/population`.  Plot the histogram of the novel case rate in week 29, `rate_w29`, and comment on what you notice.\n",

    "1. Has the overall average case rate increased from week 28 (July 5-11) to week 29 (July 12-18)?  \n",
    "2. Treating the counties as separate and equal observations: in what states did the case rate increase the most?  In what states did the case rate decrease the most (or increse the least)?  List the top 5 for each.  Do you notice any patterns in these states?\n",
    "3. Create and interpret separate visuals to display how the country case rate in week 29 relates to each of the following variables. Interpret what you see (be specific to this domain).\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. The political views in the county (as measured by the votergap in the 2020 election).\n",

    "    c. The population density of the county.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    d. Whether 50% or more of the surveyed residents in the county report that they always wore a mask in public at the time of the survey."
