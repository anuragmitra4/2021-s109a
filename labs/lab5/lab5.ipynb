    "### Summary of Ensembling\n",
    "- Ensemble models can be understood as building a bunch of models on the training data and combining them somehow\n",
    "- Visually, you can imagine a dataset consisting of each model's prediction or (if available) its probability estimate for each data point\n",
    "- The art of ensembling is in building models that complement each other, and picking a rule to combine them\n",
    "- You can even use the data to tell you what the combination rule should be, but you have to use data separate from the training and test sets to learn this rule. Simply combining the models via linear/logistic regression is a popular choice."
